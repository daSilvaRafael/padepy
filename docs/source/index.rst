padepy is a Python library for Padé approximation calculation with infinite (algebric) and finite (floating) precision. The current version support to methods: a direct method, in Frobenius sense, and Baker's recursive algorithm. ::

Brief history
=================================

A rational function matching a formal power series, at least to the term equal to the sum of denominator and numerator degree, is called a Padé approximant of that series. The name was given after Henri Padé (1863-1953) who did the first systematic study of this rational approximation in his PhD thesis [1]. However in the sec XVIII, this technique was discovered, independently, by Johann Lambert (1728-1777) and Joseph Lagrange (1736-1813). Carl Jacobi (1804 - 1851) presented a ratio of determinants to calculate a Padé approximant, and George Frobenius proved recursive relations between adjacent approximants. 

After Padé thesis, in 1961 the Padé approximants come back to the scene with Baker's works  in mathematical physics [2]. 

By the end of the 20 th century, over 6000 references were estimated about Padé approximations application in several areas, e.g, nonlinear operator theory, number theory, cryptography, statistics, numerical analysis, digital filter, signal and image processing, geometry fractal, and fluid mechanics.
