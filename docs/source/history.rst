
Brief history
=============

A rational function matching a formal power series, at least to the term equal to the sum of the denominator and numerator degree, is called a Padé approximant of that series. The name was given after Henri Padé (1863 - 1953), who did the first systematic study of this rational approximation in his Ph.D. thesis (1892) [1]. However, in the XVIII century, this technique was discovered, independently, by Johann Lambert (1728 - 1777) and Joseph Lagrange (1736 - 1813). Furthermore, Carl Jacobi (1804 - 1851) presented a ratio of determinants to calculate a Padé approximant, and George Frobenius (1849 - 1917) proved recursive relations between adjacent approximants. 

After Padé's thesis, in the 1960s, the Padé approximants come back to the scene with Baker's works in mathematical physics [2]. 

By the end of the sec XX, over 6000 references were estimated about its application in several areas, such as number theory, differential equations, numerical analysis, and fluid mechanics. For a more detailed history see [3].

Claude Brezinski [4] is one of the most influential of the XX and XXI century in the study of Padé approximants.
