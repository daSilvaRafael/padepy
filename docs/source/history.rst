
Brief history
=============

A rational function matching a formal power series, at least to the term equal to the sum of the denominator and numerator degree, is called a Padé approximant of that series. The name was given after Henri Padé (1863-1953) who did the first systematic study of this rational approximation in his Ph.D. thesis [1]. However, in sec XVIII, this technique was discovered, independently, by Johann Lambert (1728-1777) and Joseph Lagrange (1736-1813). Furthermore, Carl Jacobi (1804 - 1851) presented a ratio of determinants to calculate a Padé approximant, and George Frobenius proved recursive relations between adjacent approximants. 

After the Padé thesis, in 1961, the Padé approximants come back to the scene with Baker's works in mathematical physics [2]. 

By the end of the 20th century, over 6000 references were estimated about its application in several areas, such as number theory, differential equations, numerical analysis, and fluid mechanics.
