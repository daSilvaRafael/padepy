This package is based on python codes developed during the author's master thesis [1], a requirement for the Master's Degree in Mathematical Engineering at the Faculty of Sciences, University of Porto. The nonexistence, at the time of writing (July 2022), of a Python library exclusive to Padé approximants calculation motivated its creation.
